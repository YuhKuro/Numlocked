# Build Instructions

## PCB

#### Required Tools

- [400mm x 400 mm Hot Plate]

- [Hot Air Rework Station]†

- [Solder Paste]

- [Soldering Iron]

- [Solder]

- A few fine pairs of tweezers

- [Solder Wick]†
  
  Non-technical tools

- [Nitrile Gloves]

- An unused plastic card or something to spread the solder paste

- Isopropyl Alcohol, I suggest above 90% (99% is my go-to.)
  
  - Or better yet, [Board Cleaner]
  
  †: You do not *need* these items if you execute making them perfectly.

#### Soldering (Reflow)

Begin by placing your stencil over your pads and spreading your solder paste thinly.

Place your components carefully onto the PCB, ensuring orientation is accurate.

Place your PCB and preheat to around 180 C. Leave for around 3 minutes.

Ramp up heat to 350 C. 

Let rest.
